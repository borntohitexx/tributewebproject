            He was brought into Marvel Comics (then known as Timely Comics) by his uncle. His career began as an office assistant and editor, but he always dreamed of becoming a writer and writing a ‘Great American Novel’. As a comic book writer, he was very focused on ensuring that the heroes he created felt real. He wanted people to be able to relate to the strengths and weakness of each character. 
        </p>
        <p class="tribute-text">
            His development of the Marvel Cinematic Universe ran counter to DC’s superheroes. At the time, DC was the more popular brand. However, under his direction, he pushed new unique and creative characters that addressed more serious themes to appeal to readers of all ages.

        <p class="tribute-text">
            Aside from publishing comics for sale, he assisted with publishing comics surrounding the themes of drug use, racism, and discrimination. He also set up the “Stan Lee” foundation to improve access to literacy, culture, and arts. His contribution to the fictional world as well as bringing to light the issues of bigotry and inspiring kids to be heroes themselves makes him a real-life superhero. His legacy continues to live on in his creations.
